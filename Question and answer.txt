Brief Description: 
Language: Java
Test Framework: Junit
IDE: IntelliJ/Eclipse

Files and Folder Structure: 

Under Src folder
Human.java
    Player.java (Extends from Human)
    Coach.java  (Extends from Human)
HumanTest.java
Game.java
GameTest.java   
Team.java        
TeamTest.java
DataSaver.java            
DataSaverTest.java  
Tournament.java (Run from here)
TournamentTest.java
TestRunner.java (Test Suites for all components)

PS:
1. All the Java files which end with Test.java are runnable. 
2. Tournament.java is the main program (Runnable)
3. Files in one folder(Package) for now due to I don't want to make its way to complex. The better practice is separate the test file and functionalities files into a different folder(Package)
4. Player and Coach java file do not have their unit test cases because they extend from human class and they do not add any functions, which has unit test cases covered. I wrote those due to it could be expended (adding new features)
5. DataSaver java is for "You could persist any information you like using any method you choose.". It could save given information into text files
